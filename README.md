## ⚙️ How this README is maintained
This README is generated from the JSON data files in the repo (data/config.json and data/projects.json). A GitHub Actions workflow runs daily and will regenerate the README from those files; it commits if there are changes. See .github/workflows/update-readme.yml and scripts/generate-readme.js.

Want me to fill the projects automatically from your public repos? Provide the repo list or allow me to try fetching them again and I'll populate data/projects.json for you.
